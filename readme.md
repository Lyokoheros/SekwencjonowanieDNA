## General info and usage
This app runs entirely in Jupyter Notebook environment. 


## Autorship
This project was made with my university friend, who do the image processing while my part was prepareing the neural network and putting it together.

## Technologies
- JupyterNotebook
- Python 3 
- Tensorflow Keras
- Sklern, Skimage, Shutil, Numpy and Pandas Libraries

## Setup
This app require's no installation(beside libraries), but requires Jupyter Notebook, in which it is run. 
The main file, which is the actual program is RecaptchaSolver.ipynb

## App's Future
As this solution prove to be not succesfull project most likely wouldn't be further developed.
